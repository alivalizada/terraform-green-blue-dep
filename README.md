AWS Green-Blue Deployment with Terraform

Dears,

Welcome to my humble repo. In this repo, I have created Green-Blue deployment in AWS by Terraform. Deployment consists of Auto Scaling Group, Application Load Balancer, Launch Configuration and other resources.

Please be informed that I will improve it in the future by diving infrastructure to public and private subnets and creating a Dynamo DB database and S3 bucket as backup. There are a lot of points to improve and to add.

However, without any other additions and improvements, it is fully functional still and can be used as real time infrastructure.

I want to thank Denis Astanov and Mumshad Mannambeth for their resourceful courses and guidance. You can find their courses in www.udemy.com
